Welcome to the example of an e-commerce website I have built all by myself using:
- JavaScript,
- React,
- Context API,
- SASS, etc.

Although the app itself is pretty small and simple, it shows some of the things I am able to do using the tech I've learned throughout my coding journey.

The website can already be used as a starting point for developing a real-one online shop of any kind. It is fully responsive and works perfectly on both desktop and mobile platforms.
